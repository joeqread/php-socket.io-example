# php-socket.io-example

This is a reference for writing realtime auto-updating PHP apps, where php can send updates to the browser even after the page has rendered and browser disconnected.

I wrote this years ago before there was any Socket.IO clients for php... in fact, now that I do a GitHub search, there still isn't, all the socket.io emitter projects out there do the same thing this does.

So, just to stand out, I give you the node server source code too.  All you need for this project is your own redis server for pub/sub!
